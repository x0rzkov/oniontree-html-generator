        <p>Service's data are available as JSON. You can access them by replacing .html with .json in URL.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>

        <pre>$ curl https://onionltd.github.io/services/nytimes.json</pre>

        This site is hosted on GitHub pages, so as long as GitHub supports CORS, the API should support it too.
